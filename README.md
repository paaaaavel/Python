# Python
I am a second-year student (entry dated August 31, 2023) of the MIREA Technological University in Russia. I passed the internal exam for the highest score in computer science. I taught computer science to school graduates so that they could prepare for exams in an online format. Now I am actively continuing to study the Python programming language. I also own c++, html, css. Plans to master the Java database. In the near future, I want to learn artificial intelligence and everything related to it, because this topic itself and what AI can create just excites me. My name is Pasha and this is just the beginning of my journey.
